## 2025-02-14 - Exposed Sensitive Data in Logs
**Vulnerability:** The custom logging middleware in `server/index.ts` was logging the full JSON body of every API response, including `/api/auth/user` which returns PII (email, names) and potential tokens.
**Learning:** Custom logging implementations often miss standard security features like sanitization that established libraries might offer or document more clearly.
**Prevention:** Implement response body sanitization at the middleware level, redacting keys matching sensitive patterns (password, email, token) before logging.
